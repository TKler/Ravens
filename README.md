# Ravens
When you know the beautiful coop game "The Ravens of Thrii Shahashrii" you will understand this, 
otherwise I don't believe you really got a chance to follow it, since the rules and mechanics are quite unique.
If you are looking to build some GUI, this would be interesting as it offers different elements of which some are quite uncommen.
Mail me if you are interested as I don't care about GUI programming <3
